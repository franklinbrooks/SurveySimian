# SurveySimian - an attempt to clone a well-known data collection portal

As I was coming to the end of my studies in the Web Development Immersive program at General Assembly NYC in February of 2017, I was reflecting on the acquaintances I had made there.  Soon, we would all be heading off to start our careers in coding.  This made me anxious.  I wondered if my peers were feeling the same way.  Would we continue the friendships and support network we had fostered there?  How would we go about it? 

It struck me that some of the technologies we had been learning may be helpful in determining how the gauging the collective minds.  And, to determine the way forward.

Since I started at GA, I've taken several questionnaires on SurveyMonkey platform. It seems to be the go-to for the UX/UI folks.  Now that we have studied Ruby on Rails, and MongoDB, I thought I may be able to put together a simple survey backend that will run behing a Single-Page-Application React front.

This is the result.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
